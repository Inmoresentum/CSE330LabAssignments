## System Requirements

To test and run the application, or if you want to modify things according to your needs

you will have to install the following things.

1. Python

`python` version **3.10** or higher. Download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it
already.

To check your version of python, run:

   ```shell
    python --version
   ```

- **Note**: Unix like operating systems (`OS X, Linux and BSD`) `python` comes with the operating system itself.
  So I recommend using any **virtual environment** instead of using system environment which can break things easily.

- Further, there are **dependencies**.
  So, `requirement.txt` file is provided.

## Setup

to set up, please follow these steps:

1. clone the repo

   make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
   to check run `git --version` in your
   terminal.
   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Inmoresentum/CSE330LabAssignments.git
   ```

2. change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd CSE330LabAssignments
    ```
   or open this directory with your favourite **code editor** or **IDE**!
3. Now install required dependencies by running the following commands
   from the terminal.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
